# Orb One — Official Landing + 3D Mesh Cells + Interactive Playground (v4)

This version hardens the 3D **mesh** for iPad & local file previews:
- Tries **ES modules** first; if unavailable (common with `file://` on iPad), falls back to classic UMD scripts.
- Works when opened locally from Finder/Files and when hosted online.
- Keeps all sections after Playground and previous math/slider fixes.

Preview: unzip and open `index.html`. If the mesh panel still appears empty, ensure Wi‑Fi is on (CDN fetch).
